# Honda CBR1100XX Super Blackbird - Wiring harness adapter board

This project incorporates a printed circuit board design that allows you to connect from the OEM Honda CBR1100XX Blackbird wiring harness to your stand-alone ECU of choice.
This adapter board specifically targets the early 2000's model EFI Honda Blackbird.

In my case, it is an Australian 2002 model.

This project was spawned as a result of the notorious code 25 fault that various EFI model Blackbirds suffer from. Code 25 alludes to a faulty knock sensor or wiring, however many times it is not the knock sensor or wiring, but the stock ECU that has developed internal electronic faults. Furthermore, repairing the stock electronics is also not a straightforward option due to its packaged format. This project seeks an alternative option of replacement rather than repair. It is an ongoing project with a view to become a full plug-and-play system in the future with evolving designs.

This project will be of interest to individuals that own the iconic Honda Blackbird with technical aptitude with electronic fuel injection systems.
